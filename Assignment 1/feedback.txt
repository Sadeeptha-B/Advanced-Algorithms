Q1 Total: 4/4 

** Question 2: Wildcard Matching with Boyer-Moore ** 
Output: 0/1 
Approach: 1/3 
Feedback: You've put in an enormous amount of effort to tackle this task, and I appreciate the comprehensive and well-documented script that you've created. 
However, your approach encountered some minor errors during evaluation, causing it to fail to generate the required output for both test cases. 
For instance, on line 162, wc_gap becomes negative for some test cases, leading to an "out of index" error in line 184. 
Additionally, your implementation does not seem to produce the correct output for the example provided in the assignment sheet. 
You're on the right track to solving this task correctly, as I can see that you've implemented Boyer-Moore algorithm with Galil's optimizations. 
However, your current implementation requires further tweaking and debugging to function correctly for pattern matching with a wildcard.
